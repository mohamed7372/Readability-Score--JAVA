# Readability-Score--JAVA
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we get older, we become able to understand more and more complex texts. But how do you estimate the difficulty level of a given text, and how did the computer learn to do so? In this project, we will write a program that defines how difficult the script is and for what age it is most appropriate.
